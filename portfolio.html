                    <p>After ten years working in various professional kitchens I decided I wanted something different in life. After some time as a stay-at-home parent I returned to the workforce doing hard labor for Amazon. Not only did I receive my G.E.D. thanks to that job but I had the opportunity to try front-end web development which was all paid for by the company. I learned quickly that I really enjoy coding and earned my certificate for front-end web development through Kenzie Academy at Southern New Hampshire University.</p>

                    <p>During my time with Kenzie Academy I learned foundational skills and knowledge using HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as version control with GitHub. The main focus of the course was learning the basics and writing clean and semantically correct code. I am eager to add upon this throughout my career learning as much as I can.</p>

                    <p>I hope to fill this section with many new things as I really enjoy working on code projects. For now I have my capstone project from my certificate program which my instructor was very impressed with.</p>
